# Workflow Sketchpad

Some challenges to my workflow with this blog are:

<div class="list" markdown="1">
* Choosing what to write about

* Getting new content finished quickly

* Uploading to the server - data transfer is really slow
</div>

I have a ton of ideas about what types of content I want to put up here, but the problem is speed. I think that upgrading the vm where this is running is the solution for the 2nd and 3rd items on my list.

As for ideas for content, I'm going to list a few below.

<div class="list" markdown="1">
* **Flash - a history** - While Flash and its language Actionscript are decidedly dead now and have been for some time, I have a large collection of books about flash games and other little facets for creativity. While it doesn't have a lot of return value, it's really educational because it abstracts away event handling and asset management. Adobe's missteps and what they were trying to do with Flex when it all went sour is really interesting as well.

* **Haxe - Like Flash But Better** - Haxe is basically an extension of Actionscript. I believe Haxe, a free and open platform basically funded by the French Government as opposed to a private company as was Actionscript, profited immensely by Adobe's failures.
</div>

While the ideas above would probably be personally exciting to me, I think I should consider them outside the scope of this project. Those are compiled languages, I'm trying to learn more about web development.

**Ideas that are more practical**

<div class="list" markdown="1">
* **Tricky CSS Rules** - CSS is something I need to improve on, it can be used artistically, and it'll behave the same way on desktop and mobile. I also think that it lends itself well to the article format.

* **Test Driven Development** - This is something else that I've thought is cool for a long time, but don't really know how to do. There's not as much support for TDD in web development, but there are some, like PHPUnit and Jasmine.

* **Ionic/Cordova/Phonegap** - Recently I've been learning more about this amazing framework which compiles Android APK files from html, css, and javascript. Though I just started learning about this, I can imagine using screenshots and ported pieces of the apps to my website being really cool. It uses Angular.js, so I should include that on this list as well.

* **Angular** - Before Angular 2 was released, Dart, a compiled javascript, provided a comparable framework for building single page apps. I think the plan was for Chrome to natively run dart code, but it was cancelled and Dart has been abandoned. Angular, while not being the only popular SPA framework (React has a similar use case), it adds a lot of structure to a project and is really practical to be familiar with.  

* **Nw.js** - This is really similar to Ionic but is for making desktop apps, it's basically a chrome instance, not unlike chromedriver, which I use at work for automated tests. I've seen this used for the p5.js editor and games made with construct 2. It's really just web-pages with the browser built in which has bindings to popular OS's and hardware.

* **JavaFx** - I know a lot about JavaFx for building apps, while Java is powerful enough it the framework can actually do things comparable to Nw.js using "WebView". It makes it so you can use anything that would go on a web page and have java bindings connected to it.

* **Kotlin** - This is a language that compiles to Java developed by Jetbrains which I've learned a lot about, but haven't gotten many opportunities to work with. It ties right into JavaFx and has a much more concise javascript looking syntax. Learning about Kotlin really provides a lot of insight into what features are missing from Java and I hope to get to work with it more. [TornadoFx](https://github.com/edvin/tornadofx) is a library to simplify Javafx bindings for Kotlin which I've really wanted to play with more.

* **Ecmascript 6** - This flows directly into the topic of Angular, which is a common use case for ES6. ES6 still needs to be compiled in order to run in the browser, but that's actually trivial using Babel with PhpStorm. Similar to Kotlin in that learning about ES6 provides perspective on features missing from normal javascript, I'm sure it'll translate well to blog format. I've already read a few books on the subject but haven't actually gotten to use ES6.
</div>

I think in compiling this list I can see where this blog might end up going. I should focus on speed and select a few CSS topics to start with, read more about Angular, Ionic and Nw.js, and plan some topics involving Kotlin and ES6.

I shouldn't even consider looking at Game Development topics, Haxe, or Actionscript stuff until later because it's likely to bog me down and being compiled languages they aren't really in the scope of this blog. Java, while it's also a compiled language, can tie directly into relevant topics here because of the WebView component of JavaFx and because of Android.

Writing this workflow draft seemed like a waste of time at first, but I think will benefit the project because I feel like I know where to start and where I hope to go with these writings.
