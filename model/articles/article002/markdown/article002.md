# Cold Springs Fire Evacuation

>Bullhorns and a burnt smell ... this can't be good

... getting evacuated from my home because of a nearby wildfire has kind of disrupted my flow a little. Busy working on this very website I tried my best to ignore the sirens and horn honking in the canyon, finally the upstairs neighbors started making a ruckus with the garden hose, spraying water everywhere.

I didn't think much of it until one of them shouts my name through the screen door, I replied but he didn't hear me. They took off and again I was able to focus on what I was doing.

  This website is coming along, I started with a digital ocean droplet with a simple LAMP configuration, then registered a domain though "namecheap.com". They weren't my first choice, "network solutions" couldn't process a paypal transaction... nonetheless I had all I needed to start this thing.
  
I threw up a homepage and embedded a p5js sketch on it, unfortunately when I tested it on mobile I found that canvas animations are really costly in terms of performance. For now I'm just going for static content, maybe I can put a bunch of animation and interactive stuff later. 

Basically, I've got an xml data store in the root of my model directory, jquery and bootstrap and my own css file in the view directory. I was a little torn deciding if these articles and the pictures are "view" or "model". I decided that they're the model - they're just files, pulled into the view template via directives in the datastore.

I felt pretty satisfied with my progress as I watching the files uploading from my local to the server. Just then the power drops out.

It's suddenly super quiet in my neighborhood - finally I step outside and note this heavy burnt smell in the air and start putting two and two together, and also note there's a parks ranger parked at the end of my driveway talking to my neighbor. I walk out there and my neighbor, not the ranger, explains to me that there's a wildfire nearby but I can stay if i want to.

With that in mind, I gathered up a bike I've been meaning to fix up for my neice and start messing around with it on the portch. With increasing concern, I am watching this huge white smoke cloud growing over the hillside beyond the ridge. I finally put the bike away and just stand behind the screen door watching it, wondering what's about to happen and what I should do.

It's at this time that the ranger comes walking up to my house and tells me to leave because "you can't outrun a fire like this".

This is Colorado. There's burnt out regions all around here - there was the Sugarloaf wildfire that left the whole ridge a grassland with torched tree trunks, and more recently the Four Mile fire which took weeks to put out. Was this wildfire about to do the same thing to my neighborhood?
  
I think anyone in a simlar situation would feel the same way, suddenly faced with the prospect of all of your worldly possessions being destroyed and having to grab a few select things and get out. It's kind of humbling realizing that your stuff actually is pretty worthless at a time like that. I took my chromebook, mobile devices, my bivy, and a long sleeved shirt. I realized directly after leaving the house that I forgot *food*.

When I got to down to the canyone I met another officer who offered to drive me to the Nederland highschool where all of the evacuees are. I make a quick decision to hitchhike to Boulder instead, looking back on that, it was a brilliant decision.

So that was yesterday - I ended up sleeping in the bivy after hiking up the Enenomie trail. It's been years since I last did that, ironic how in spite of my wanting to do more camping/ long weekend trips, I end up actually doing so only in an emergency, not for pleasure. It was a cold and windy and I slept without any kind of padding or groundcloth. All I had was my long sleeved shirt, it was a long and fitful rest, still, a lot better than dealing with the public at large, salvation army foot and cots at the Nederland high school.
  
So I've written my first article! How contrived of me to seize this dramatic event as an opportunity to make my website better, I guess it is what it is.
  
No code samples in this one, that'll be later. Captain's log signing off...
