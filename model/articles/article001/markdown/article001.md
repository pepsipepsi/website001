# Inside the Burn Zone

This is from the second time I explored the burn zone since the evacuation was lifted the day before yesterday. I was in some of the same places but walked down into Sherwood Gulch which is an open field. Surprisingly, there is a lot of the grassy marsh that got singed, but it's mainly the groupings of trees that were burned deeply down there. While the area near Ridge Road, which is pictured here, was badly burnt in places, the worst burn I saw was on the north side of Hurricane Hill.

I was actually out there shortly before the wildfire running along an old mining road that goes back there, it's really dense forest, there aren't any houses. This forest was the first to burn, and there were some very dramatic photos taken from the south side of Hurricane on the day of the fire capturing 100 foot flames shooting up from that area.

All things considered, when trying to calculate a value of losses to a fire like this, a large empty forested area simply isn't worth as much as a neighborhood, which is what is directly east of the forests in the photos below.

This area was the frontline of a high stakes battle fought by slurry bombers and firefighters just one week ago. I tried to document the evidence of their tactics below.

Firstly, this is what this area used to look like before the fire. I've come across resident moose and deer on this very section of path in the past.

Here you can see Ridge Road painted orange with a fire-retardant slurry. This is the stuff that gets dropped by the aircraft, and though you might imagine that they would want to drop these chemicals directly on the burning areas to put the fire out, it's really a way of drawing the strategic lines around the perimeter of the burn zone to prevent it from crossing.

If you can pick up on the orange tint of the nearby trees, you'll see where they drew such a perimeter in the forest itself. Beyond this stripe of orange, you can see the burn zone.

The edge of the burn zone had cut trees which were further sawed into sections to create a larger space between the burn area and the perimeter. I would imagine that at a certain point, when the fire was still much further down the hill, they selected this place as a key area for holding back the fire. I'd imagine that it would've been difficult to pull people away from fighting the fire where it was actually burning at the moment to widen this space in the woods, but it looks like it was worth it.

I don't know what this orange stuff is, but I don't think I saw any branches that were painted with it in this way burnt at all. The flames must not have been as high at the edge of the burn zone either, you can see the tops of the trees are still there.
![photo006](model/articles/article001/images/photo006.jpg "photo number 006")

You can kind of see from this group of trees that the fire did get over the area where the trees were cut, That might be why the trees behind the burnt ones are so hevily coated in the orange stuff.
![photo007](model/articles/article001/images/photo007.jpg "photo number 007")

I don't know how they managed to save this house - the area in front of it is part of the burn zone as well. This house certainly was surrounded by high flames for a long time while the fire was burning here, it seems miraculous that they were able to preserve it.
![photo008](model/articles/article001/images/photo008.jpg "photo number 008")

This outcropping is a well known landmark for me, and I distinctly remember wandering around trying to find it on more than one occasion because the forest was pretty dense here. Before the fire you wouldn't have been able to see it at all from this distance. This is probably about 25 feet tall, and I think the first 15 feet are just coated in soot.
![photo009](model/articles/article001/images/photo009.jpg "photo number 009")

This photo was taken from atop the outcropping in the previous photo. The smaller burnt hill with grassy sections on the right is the lower part of Sherwood Gulch (the more well known part of it is miles to the west). You can see that it's the forested parts that burned, the grass is almost untouched. To the left is Bonanza, where most of the later photos were taken. In the distance beyond that is the north side of Hurricane Hill, which was completely burned.
![photo010](model/articles/article001/images/photo010.jpg "photo number 010")

This was the home of a well known Ridge Road resident who would walk in and out of this tract of National Forest. I'm saddened to think of that person having to move on from this place and seeing it in ruin like this. It's the only house in this part of the forest.
![photo011](model/articles/article001/images/photo011.jpg "photo number 011")

This is peeking though a patch of woods that wasn't burnt at all into the burn zone. It's interesting that the fire doesn't seem to be able to go downhill very easily. That's the only reason I could see that this, and the area lower down, was completely unharmed.
![photo012](model/articles/article001/images/photo012.jpg "photo number 012")

I've explored this area before, but with the deadfall around I must have missed this mine entrance. It's difficult to see in this picture, but there is a path leading up the hill to the left of the mine, and it's reinforced with stacked stones.
![photo013](model/articles/article001/images/photo013.jpg "photo number 013")

This is further up the hill - I never noticed this one either. You can see that it's just a little caved in tunnel, it keeps on going beneath the hillside. I would never go inside of one of these, the thought gives me nightmares.
![photo014](model/articles/article001/images/photo014.jpg "photo number 014")

This is the forest behind Bonanza, a densly packed subdivision. The houses are actually just beyond the high point of this hill. This area was deeply burned, there's no pine needles left on even the highest branches here. It's amazing to me how the ground is just coated in a layer of soot. This used to be filled with dense foliage and deadfall.
![photo015](model/articles/article001/images/photo015.jpg "photo number 015")

This is in the neighborhood of Bonanza. The fire came close enough to this house to melt its electic meter, the areas to either side of this path were burnt.
![photo016](model/articles/article001/images/photo016.jpg "photo number 016")

Up the road, there were two houses that were destroyed. I took some pictures of the inside of the car but didn't include them here. Funny how these houses were burnt absolutely to the ground, you'd almost never know that they were there.
![photo017](model/articles/article001/images/photo017.jpg "photo number 017")

Only the foundation supports for this house are left. The trees in the front yard weren't burnt at all, it's a really unlucky that this one got burnt, but I can imagine that with the fire this close to the other 30 houses in the neighborhood the firefighters were doing everything they could not to let it get any further than this.
![photo018](model/articles/article001/images/photo018.jpg "photo number 018")

Again, there's almost nothing left of the house. It's amazing how a fire like this just erases everything.
![photo019](model/articles/article001/images/photo019.jpg "photo number 019")

It's just a range of soot and deeply burnt trees. While I think some of the trees may live through this, I don't think ones that have been burnt from top to bottom in this was can. This is going to be a pretty baren area.
![photo020](model/articles/article001/images/photo020.jpg "photo number 020")

This is actually the beginning of the trail along the backside of Hurricane Hill. Further down this trail is the widest and most completely burned area I'd explored. The day before I came out to take these photos I hiked the whole way through, and it's just devastating. This is the edge, and you can see that some of the tops of these Aspen are ok, but beyond here for about a couple miles it's just a charred sooty mess. I climbed Hurricane Hill through this burnt zone, and there is a similar perimeter where they painted a section orange with slurry. There are some houses at the top of this hill, and thankfully they were able to save all of them.   
![photo021](model/articles/article001/images/photo021.jpg "photo number 021")

This used to be a historic cabin which dated back to the mining days. There was a group of two buildings near here which I checked on yesterday which were also lost. It's a real shame I didn't document them before they were destroyed. One was insulated with old fashioned cereal boxes, probably from the 1910s, and there was a shack that was obviously someone's bedroom which had clippings from the comics all over the walls dating back to that period as well. You can see a modern house just beyond the trees in this photo. I'm pretty sure the firefighters didn't even know these historic buildings were back here.
![photo022](model/articles/article001/images/photo022.jpg "photo number 022")

This is back where I took the first photos, it was in this area that the wildfire actually managed to cross Ridge Road and actually burnt the cliffside all the way down to the canyon. This exposed the forests down there to great risk and I remember reading about some deep concerns about the fire actually getting to the other side of Boulder Creek. Thankfully the firefighters were able to prevent that, I'm certain that this would have been a much, much more costly ordeal if that had occured.
![photo023](model/articles/article001/images/photo023.jpg "photo number 023")

Facing the south, this is overlooking the canyon where the fire made its way down this gully. Another unfortunate resident lost his home, I saw on the news that there was some valuable World War 2 memorabilia stored inside, including a fighter pilot's helmet and uniform. It looks like the house got the worst of what fire there was here, it's bizarre that the tree next to the house is unsinged, though it looks like they had some of that orange stuff on them.

This is a really steep gully behond this house leading down to the canyon. It's hard to imagine fire going down a cliff like that, I'm sure the wind was helping it. The area on the other side of the canyon is a massive section of forest with no roads or trails all the way to Magnolia, which is not to be considered any kind of barrier to even more forest further south. Had the fire crossed the canyon, this would have been an unmitigated disaster.

That does it for the photos which I took this evening while exploring the burn zone from the Cold Springs Fire, which very nearly destroyed the neighborhoods of Bonanza and Saint Anton. I would like to thank the firefighters who worked so hard to protect our homes, and to the National Guard who chose the right strategy to protect Boulder County from what could have been a massive environmental tragedy.
